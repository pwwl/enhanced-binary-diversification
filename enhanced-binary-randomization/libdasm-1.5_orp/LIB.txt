How to compile library in Unix environment
==========================================

1. Edit Makefile. You may want to check out variables CC
and the installation path PREFIX. If you plan to use dynamic
library (libdasm.so), you may need to add /usr/local/lib
(or whatever you defined as PREFIX) in the linker cache path.
This is usually in /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux systems.

2. Compile with 'make'

3. Install with 'make install'

4. Rebuild your linker cache (or reboot)
